# Flying, In Space, but with Asteroids!
Ludum Dare Jam #48

Our team took this jam as an opportunity to brush up with Unity, and we knew going in that this project isn't one we would be able to continue with after the event ended. While there's not a whole ton of riveting gameplay in our game, we were all pretty happy with where we ended the weekend. Read on to learn how to play!

# Gameplay

##Controls:
You can look around with the mouse, and move around the ship with W,A,S, and D keys. 
Left-click with the mouse to interact with objects. 

## Objective - Don't die!
Energy is what keeps this bucket of bolts going, and if you run out, that's the end of the line.

Management has required that all backup power systems be removed due to budgetary constraints, but the auto-turrets will harvest energy when destroying blue asteroids. 

## The Main Console
Below, you can see the primary control panel of the ship, along with energy and repair resource gauges.

Interacting with any of the buttons on the console will steer the ship. 
Be warned: management has cut thruster maintenance budgets and steering may be... imprecise. 

## Asteroids

Management has indicated that crashing into these would be... Unpleasant. 


## Structural Damage
In the (extremely) likely event of pilot error, parts of the ship may be destroyed. If this should happen, a force-field will spring up to protect you from the lonely, cold vacuum of space.

**WARNING** Each active force field will drain additional energy from the ship's core. Promptly repairing broken parts is recommended.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Management has included only a limited supply of repair materials on board. The auto-turrets will harvest more when destroying yellow asteroids.

## Weapons Modules
Due to prior incidents involving Mandatory Planet Recyclers, an exhaust vent, and torpedoes, Managment has required that all weapons systems on-board be automated.

Each of these modules controls the weapons systems for one side of the ship. If they are destroyed, the corresponding weapons will cease firing until the module is repaired.
